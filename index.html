<p>I just finished graduate school. I was on the path to getting my PhD in Computer Science studying the artificial intelligence (AI) alignment problem, but after four years, five successful papers, and three failed papers, I realized that academic research doesn’t _align_ (haha!) with my personal skillset. I took a few months off to travel the world and gain some perspective, and now I’m back.</p>

<p>During graduate school, I honed my passion for researching science and learning the philosophies of effective altruism (EA), and developed a new passion for written communication. I now seek roles where I can combine my love of science and philosophy with my skills in communication to educated people about EA and AI in outreach roles.</p>

<p>Outside of writing and research, I care deeply about the environment, energy, and deep ecology. I spend a lot of time backpacking, hiking the PCT, camping on the L.A. beach, hammocking under the stars of the Rockies, float-tripping in rural Missouri, and hosteling in Southeast Asia and Europe. I’ve built most of my own furniture, and led groups building large wooden art installations. I love black ink drawing and practicing calligraphy. I cook lots of tacos, curry, and BBQ, and occasionally brew beer for final projects in undergrad. I shoot well above par in disc golf, and am now trying to learn how to grow my own salsa.</p>

<p>Cheers,
Blake</p>
